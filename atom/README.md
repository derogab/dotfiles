# dotfiles/atom

Something to use with **atom**.

**Install Atom**

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest) and install it. Or build it directly from [source code](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/linux.md).

**Subfolder available**

[`./ftp/`](ftp/) contains important information to manage an ftp connection.

[`./beautify/`](beautify/) is useful to improve a file.

**Install All**

This is a fast command to install all the atom packages (in the subfolders) from the terminal.

```bash
apm install Remote-FTP atom-beautify
```
